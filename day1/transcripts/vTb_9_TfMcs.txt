hi investors welcome to soic so in today's video we'll be talking about top 5 reasonably valued businesses that I am studying right now so again before I start the video this video is not meant for as a buy or sell recommendation these are just those businesses which I've been studying right now and I'll be posting detailed videos on these businesses going forward as well so what we'll do in the video is that we'll go to different different sectors and we will try to identify companies which are reasonably valued and these are the companies which I'm studying right now and one common trait across all these companies will be that these companies will be probably will be doubling their net block that is the amount of property plant and Machinery that they have and they'll be doing a lot of capex going forward and most of these capex will be done from internal accruals or some of these companies will also be taking debt and one more factor that we are trying to identify for making this video is that these companies will have competitive advantage in place is that majority of these companies will have return on Capital employed above 15 which ensures that their Roc is more more than their cost of capital and this is why we are studying these businesses and also one thing that we will try to do is that these businesses are reasonably valued so this is why we are studying them [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] to the first business and this business belongs to the hospital sector so last year as well we made a video on top 5 reasonably valued businesses where we talked about Ki Industries Usha Martin HCL Technologies narana and a lot of those businesses also did well but even at that point of time our idea was to look at multiple sectors so this time in the first business week that we have is a business by the name of narayana which is a hospital so why are we studying this business at the moment and basically why are we doing a lot of homework on this business so first simple reason is is that this business is going to double its net block going forward that is currently the business has a net block of almost 2000 crore on its balance sheet and the company is doing almost a 2000 crore capex in the next two to three years so when it comes to analyzing the hospital sector one thing that you have to remember is that there are multiple types of capexes so one type of capex is a Brownfield capex so what is the Brownfield capex suppose if a hospital is already present and it already has an adjacent land right next to its Hospital building so if the hospital ends up expanding in that manner so then it will be considered a Brownfield capex because it already has a land in place and it is already partly utilizing the land second type of capex is Green Field within a new city now suppose if gangaram Hospital from Delhi goes to Mumbai and sets up a new hospital so gangaram is a very famous Hospital in Delhi but ganga Ram is not so well known in Mumbai so it will take gangaram six to seven years to just break even so this is Green Field within the new city so this is why you'll see uh like businesses like Kim's hospital where a lot of Greenfield capexes have been announced in New City then probably this is one of the reasons why the stock has been flat as well so third type of capex is Greenfield within the existing City now suppose if a hospital has run out of space and it wants to expand within its existing City now suppose if if gangaram wants to open one more hospital within Delhi so because the brand name is already established so it is much easier to utilize the capacities so this is what narayana is doing right now is that they are doing Greenfield within existing cities that is they have one Hospital in Cayman Island and over there they are setting up oncology blocks so cancer is a very fast spreading disease and what has happened is that this this therapy is growing at a very fast pace so they never had an oncology Block in Cayman Island so they're setting up a oncology Block in Cayman Island secondly they're also doing these capexes in Bangalore as well in Bangalore they have a very large established Hospital and they're also looking for land for doing capex in Kolkata so basically all the capexes which will be done going forward in next two three years will be done within the existing cities and this is why we are studying this hospital because if you look at the balance sheet of this company the return on Equity of this company what is the formula for return on Equity does net profit upon shareholders Equity the return on Equity if you just look at this quarter and analyze it the return on equity for a hospital is more than 27 to 28 so again if I tell you about a business where Roe is 27 to 28 and it is doubling its net block over the next two to three years so that is why we end up studying the businesses if you look at this piece of note from the corn call so in the corn call they are talking about is that they are spending 2000 crores to double their net block and the type of return on Capital they they expect is close to 20 so again that gives us an idea roughly their payback will be close to three to four years when they do capex so this is why we are studying this hospital because PE ratio as well isn't too elevated as of now if you go to uh on a forward basis and even on a trailing basis if you look at it so p ratio is 30 whereas POS are trading at a PE ratio of more than 40 times so this is the first business that we are studying right now now coming to the second business now second business belongs to a commodity sector and what is the commodity sector that is iron over production and iron pellets production now this is a commodity business where the debt on the balance sheet has fallen from close to 2000 crores to being net debt free currently the balance sheet actually has cash so if you just look at the balance sheet right now so company if you subtract out all the debt of the balance sheet with the cash in Investments the company will have actually 538 crores of cash and Investments on the balance sheet so from a position of more than 2000 crores of debt to almost being net debt free is something that we definitely want to study as well so remember last year we studied a business by the name of Usha Martin and over there as well a lot of De leveraging happened and that business sold off its steel plant and it almost became net debt free so similarly this is a commodity business and the type of commodity business that we are studying right now so you have to be very very careful while you are listening to this analysis because commodity prices fluctuate a lot and if commodity prices fluctuate then the stock price also automatically fluctuates but what we have to be very very understanding of is that whenever we are talking about commodity businesses so you have to look at it from a bottom to Peak cycle or from Peak to Peak cycle but if you end up analyzing these businesses at a peak cycle like this business was at a peak cycle in 21 then it becomes very very risky in the near term that is next two to three years so the name of the business is gpil and why are we studying this business is because this business is and I has announced massive capacity expansions so what does the company do is that the company is a producer of iron ore and also a lot of products in the downstream that is it does iron ore mining iron ore pellets and also it is setting up its own steel plant at the moment because it will be purely integrated because they already have the raw materials in place so what is the uh like expansion that the company is doing right now so for iron ore mining currently the capacity is 2.35 million tons and they're like spending almost 200 crores to expand the capacity to almost 6 million tons whereas for iron ore pellets where they where they are exporting a lot of high grade iron ore pellets currently their capacity is 2.7 million tonne and they're adding additional capacity of 3 million tonne that is at a cost of 800 crores and this entire capex will take 18 months in the case of iron ore mining and it will take 36 months in the case of pellets if you look at the competitive advantage of the company it is ownership of a proprietary asset that is the mines if you look at captive mining Edge then the market price of iron node if you just compare it with the like captive or landed cost because they have their own mines then you will see almost a 40 to 45 percent difference so this is why looking at such type of companies becomes very very interesting and finally if you look at the free cash flow generation of the business so post FY 17 the company has consistently generated free cash flow in FY 18 it generated 82.7 crores NFI 19 to 21 crores in FY 20 163 crores NFI 21 775 crores and then f522 company generated nearly house uh like 704 crores of free cash flow so that is why we are studying such type of businesses because see uh we don't know where the commodity prices go that is for sure right so there is a commodity pricing call as well but if the company is uh debt free and if the company has plans of expansion in until fy25 fi 26 and even till fy29 because their long-term plan is to take the iron ore capacity to almost 9 million tons per annum which is currently close to 2.7 million tons per alarm so if those things end up happening and if the balance sheet is debt free and the company is free cash flow generating then over a period of time just because of one cycle these things become very very interesting but mind you as a retail investor you have to be very careful because these are coming and if you are studying commodity businesses then fluctuations will happen like what like what happened in Rain Industries like what happened in heg so remember these are commodity businesses so this was the second one this was something unique because after a lot of time we studied a commodity business on the channel third business now belongs to the qsr category so name of the business is Westlife and Westlife is the master franchisee of McDonald's in west and south India so you might be wondering that the PE ratio for this business is close to 100 times then why study this business and why even call it reasonable in the first place so what you have to realize is that in this business in last 10 years they've opened a lot of new stores because of which the depreciation spends look elevated so in such type of scenario what we prefer to look at is Cash Pad that is uh just looking at the profit after tax and adding back the depreciation but in this scenario as well because of India's 116 the the picture of depreciation also looks a bit uh like elevated so we try to subtract all the rent costs as well from depreciation so probably by fi 23 and this business is going to do 252 260 crores of Cash Pad and this is already given in their investor presentation you can check as well for nine month f523 they have mentioned 250 crores of cashback if you subtract all the rentals and if you just analyze it to fy23 so there are cash profit of attacks will be close to 250 crores and currently the Rhythm so basically on a fat basis they the 44 times Cash Pad earnings but again what you have to realize even though the business might look a bit expensive but in Indian context when qsr companies end up growing they definitely get a higher multiple as compared to others so what is the rationale for studying this business at the moment and why I'll be making a video as well so recently I visited uh Bangalore Mumbai and I also went to Hyderabad and in all the three places I uh I I went to McDonald's as well so simple reason was that McDonald's usually earlier when I go to a when I used to go to McDonald's like 10 years ago then the burgers which I used to have used to cost 30 or 40 rupees Max but these days if you go to a McDonald's in Mumbai or if you go to a McDonald's in Hyderabad or if you go to McDonald's in Bangalore then you will realize that these that they have launched Gourmet Burgers and also they have launched meal options and there is also MEK Cafe which is present within the McDonald's store only so what has happened is that the per uh Bill value like per order Bill value has gone up so this can also be seen by this data that in 2015 to 2016 their average sales per store per annum used to be somewhere between 4.5 to 5 crores and that has now gone almost close to seven crores why has that happened because of these new innovation in the menu is that now if you go to a McDonald's then if you even order one meal then that meal will cost you close to 350 to 400 rupees so just to give you some Scuttle but feedback that uh like six of us went to McDonald's and our final bill value was close to 2300 rupees and just eight or nine years ago I could have never imagined myself paying 2300 rupees for six people in a McDonald's so what has happened is that they have given their fy27 guidance is that in the investor day that they have planned for opening 620 stalls which are currently close to 340 to 360 anywhere between that and they want to double their sales so what is the guidance that is that they want to take their sales to 4000 to 4500 crores and what is the profit after tax margin guidance it is close to eight to ten percent so you can just simply create a bear and bull scenario is that in a bare scenario you can just take 4000 crore SL and take eight percent as fat margin in a bull scenario you can take 4500 crores a sale and 10 percent as profit after tax margin and what is happening in this industry is that if you look at the entire size of opportunity so the Indian informal eating out industry is somewhere close to 3.2 lakh crores in size and what is McDonald's catering to it is catering to chicken burger and desserts which is 66 of the market if you also look uh at this South India McDonald's stores they've also launched Fried Chicken and fried chicken has already started contributing 50 lakh per annum in one store sales in South India so that also gives you an idea is that McDonald's isn't taking any format risk whereas if you look at the story of jubilant Food Works they are opening Hong's kitchen they're going for Popeyes so that is the idea of a format risk that we don't know if those formats succeed or not whereas in the case of McDonald's they are doing all these Innovations within their within their existing format so this is one of the businesses which I've been studying in the qsr space and also in the recent quarter results if you look at same store sales growth and what were your sales growth from the same store so McDonald's like undoubtedly have like ended up outperforming devyani Sapphire and also jubilant Food Works so this is why this is one of the businesses that we are studying within the qsr space now before we talk about the fourth business the three biggest problems for a retail investor are that is when to buy when to Pyramid of and when to sell and these three problems are so big that retail investors end up averaging down on a losing stock so let me tell you about the story of my uncle that he bought one of the housing finance companies in 2018 2019 by the name of dhfl and he started averaging down in it and he kept on averaging down till it became almost 65 to 70 percent of his portfolio and what ended up happening is that the stock kept falling and he kept averaging down so this is why a framework in place is really really important because if you have a system and a framework in place you will never ever blow up on a portfolio level one or two stocks will always be in losses but you have a framework in place of three W's that is when to buy when to pyramid and when to sell then at a portfolio level it will be really difficult to make losses so in the soic membership we have a detailed course of almost 14 hours which will help you to understand when to buy when to sell and when to average on Pyramid and that is the mission of soic membership is to create a system for you to uh to address all these important three W questions if you want to sign up for the soic membership then the link is given in the description box below coming back to the fourth business and fourth business that we have over here again belongs to the consumption category and this is a business that we have already discussed in a video five to six months ago name of the company is CCL products and it is the world market leader in processed coffee if you look at the entire coffee value chain then you will see that there are people who are growing coffees who own coffee plantations then you will see there are people or Industries which are involved in coffee processing and then there are people who are involved in trading of the coffee and finally then they then there are businesses which are involved in Coffee retail and then there are businesses who also have their coffee shops throughout the entire value chain the coffee processors make the maximum on amount of return on Capital employed and CCL products is the world's largest coffee processor so what is happening in the business is that the business has more than one thousand blends of coffee and suppose if you are a customer of Cecil products coffee then what what ends up happening is that if you buy your coffee from any super Mutt and if that Supermart changes its Supply from CCL to someone else but you like that particular Taste of coffee so it becomes very very difficult to change the suppliers because if you change the taste then the customer might stop coming back so this is why having a customer in place or having like CCL product in place as your supplier makes it a very very sticky business so looking at this business why study it because after 2011 to 2016 phase when the stock went on to become a huge multi-bagger the company expanded its capacity they all they more than doubled the capacity and between 2016 to 2020 the stock was stagnant because the capacities were this stagnant they didn't increase the capacities at all now post 2021 they've announced that they will increase their capacities from 37 500 tons to almost 77 000 tons by the end of fy25 so this is why we are studying the business because this business again is in that phase where the growth will be accelerated as compared to the last four years and they are also trying to make a b2c brand within the Indian subcontinent is that they've also launched Continental Coffee within India but majority of the revenues still come from B to B that is by selling to other businesses and processing coffee as per their needs so this is the fourth business that we are studying and finally coming to the fifth business that we are studying is that we've studied a lot of times on this channel is a bank by the name of equitas small Finance Bank so this Bank used to be 60 of unsecured loans that is microfinance and over a period of time microfinance is only 18 of the product mix so 82 percent of the product mix is of secured loans and finally after multiple quarters the bank after a long time delivered a return on asset of more than two percent I think in the recent quarter there uh return on asset was close to 2.2 percent and also after the reverse merger has been completed between equitas holco and equitas small Finance Bank what has happened is that the book value per share for Equity small Finance bank has gone up to almost 45 rupees because there was some cash lying on the balance sheet of equitas Holdings so when you do a reverse margin that cash gets added to the net worth So currently the net worth is close to 5000 crores and the entire market cap is close to 7200 to 7300 crores and The Price to Book value on a trailing 12-month basis is close to 1.4 times so we have seen in the Indian context when the return on asset crosses two percent and when the return on equity crosses 15 to 16 percent uh financials or Banks usually in the Indian context end up getting two to three times Price to Book so we have seen that with the past scale study it might not happen with this one but we are just studying the business because of the valuation Arbitrage and because of superior return metrics as compared to a lot of peers so these are the five businesses that we are studying right now so apart from this other two businesses we are studying right now is that one is into chlorination chemistry again but the market cap is less than thousand kilowatts so you can go and find the business using your screeners and the other business is into casting so these are the two more businesses that that we are studying because the PA multiples for both these businesses are less than 15 times so these are the top five businesses that we are studying right now and we will be posting detailed analysis on some of these businesses in the coming weeks forward and also if you love this video do not forget subscribing to the channel and liking this video and also let me know in the comment section below at which business uh you find the most interesting and which this you are also going to study thank you so much for joining us hope to see you in the next business
