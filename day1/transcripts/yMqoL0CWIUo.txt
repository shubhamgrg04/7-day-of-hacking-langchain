Hi Investors! Welcome to SOIC You need to remember 2 things when studying a business or stock There are 2 types of research 1st is initial research & for the same SOIC YouTube channel was created Initial research is the most difficult Recently we made a video on SRF with 50 mins of initial research That took 15-20 hrs to research
Initial research is tuff part of investing 2nd is maintenance research 
Post initial research its maintenance research You just have to study the idea
If some development is ongoing in a business You just have to listen to their concalls after few quarters As an idea to confirm your initial research in the business Similarly, we’ll be discussing few businesses today Few already discussed on the channel & few undiscussed as well Towards the end we’ll discuss 2-3 more businesses We will create videos on them in future The 1st idea is about SRF
Recently we made a video on SRF SRF is a diversified chemical co & have 4 main businesses 1 is packaging films business including BOP & BOPET films
But this is a cyclical business 2 is Technical textile business used in Tyre belting cord This is legacy business & once was 60% business by sales But now it's just 17% of sales with no major growth 3rd is chemical business & in turn have 2 divisions A is Refrigerant gases & other chemicals used in ACs & Fridges B is speciality chemicals 
They manufacture intermediates for Agro & Pharma intermediates They have received orders for active ingredients in Agro chemicals If you look at the value chain of both, it is a bit similar There is Key starting material>> Intermediates>>Active ingredients>>Formulation SRF is working on key starting material & intermediates for both In agrochemicals they are entering active ingredients as well By doing forward integration in many projects In a nutshell, this is the simple explanation for the business of SRF Let’s discuss the recent results There is a complete video available on SRF in the channel as well Let’s discuss the results & business mix In H1 FY23, if you look at the SRFs growth There is 31% YOY, 16% growth in PBT, 25.8% growth in PAT If you compare it with Q2 FY23 & Q2 FY22 If you compare H1FY23 & FY22, there is a 40% growth in PAT To know the contribution let’s first breakdown the chemical business There is 62.5% growth in top line YOY, 106% growth in EBIT 58.6% growth in H1FY23, 119.2% growth in EBIT The chemical business of SRF is doing good at the moment They have announced a new capex in chemical business of worth 700 crs They are planning to set up 4-5 new plants in agrochemicals In Pharmaceuticals, they’ve announced a capex of 9-10 crs But their vision statement in chemical business is of 12-13K crs of capex over the next 3-4 years B/w FY24 & FY28, their plan is to spend 12-13K crs just in chemical business To make it more structural in nature
Let’s discuss their different types of chemical business 1st: Refrigerant Gases(RGs) & know what’s happening in there In recent management meet of SRF, many investors visited their plant in Dahej The plant is of 294 acres & 180-190 acres i.e 60% is currently utilised They have to buy a new parcel of land There is very interesting mental model of Prof. Bruce i.e., “Competition Demystified” It is about local economies of scale Your manufacturing cost decrease when you do all activities at 1 place Similarly, if you look at Dahej plant & their commentary You’ll find out when the 290 crs facility was started The facility had an investment of 2500 crs in 2017 with 1700 crs revenue But today investment is of 5500 crs & revenue is almost similar The incremental asset turn of this land is 1.2x Asset Turns is Sales/ Assets
How much am I earning on an investment of 1 ₹ Earlier I had a plant of 290 crs but slowly I started its utilization Since I’m using 60% so my asset turns of the land parcel will increase SRF is making raw material in house
In SRFs case its Chloromethane, R22 Gases You’re making chemicals out of it in a big complex Its similar in their Rajasthan plant, what ends up happening is that? You tend to develop local economies of scale
As mentioned by Prof. Bruce Green Let’s 1st discuss their RGs, the price of RGs is elevated at the moment Therefore, there is an abnormal impact on results The sales of RGs as a % of sales are 17% & capacity is going to freeze There are 3 classes in RGs & we discussed in video as well 1st is CFCs depleting ozone layer & you might have heard RGs depleting ozone layer 7 because of which their usage stopped There is HCFC,HFC & HFO
SRF manufactures HFC & R22 HCFC at the moment R22 is also a gas phasing out by 2030. But in here you need to look at capex plans 1st capex plan: R32 in HFCs is used in many applications SRF is expanding its capacity in R32 by 15000 MTPA If you do the expansion after 2023, A/c to Montreal Protocol
You will not get any compensation. Therefore, expansion has to be done now
There’s a RGs in US called R134a Upon which there is an anti-dumping duty on China of 150-200% This has been expanded more from FY17 to FY21 In the expansion plan, we discussed about R32 & R22 R22 will be phased out by 2030 & can’t be used in the world That is for emission causing agents in atmosphere SRF is expanding capacity for non-emissive usage of R22 They’ll make TFE from R22 & PTFE from TFE & PTFE is called Teflon Teflon is hardened plastic used in lot of applications
You might have seen Teflon pans It finds use in Kitchen, Industries, Planes & it requires no maintenance Gujarat Fluorochemicals (GFL) is the only co in India making PTFE Their fully backward integrated supply in PTFE is about to start from Q4 The capacity is of 5K MTPA It will contribute to 300-400 crs of sales with 60-65% gross margins As indicated in concalls They have separate land for PTFE By which they can achieve 10K MTPA capacity from 5K MTPA They’re launching a commodity grade PTFE Initially you enter commodity grade & then enter value added grade But why is it imp to study? 
Because when we’ll discuss Fluorine chemistry The players in Fluorination have massive opportunities in Semiconductors, EVs & 5G implementation Because the value chain of PVDF, FKM opens up from here Recently they integrated in management meet as well Over a period of time They will start making diff Flouropolymers like PVDF, FKM along with PTFE in downstream Feedstock for all is R22, PFE & they are already in house backward integrated Their Chloro methane plant, the basic feed stock as shown in infographic They have doubled the capacity of Chloromethane plant as well You become lowest cost producer after having basic feed stock Also, you can go into forward integration of products You need to understand this thing in their plan of RGs 2nd is the business of specialty chemicals with 40-45 products Their sales in specialty chemicals is ~ 2.7-2.8K crs But their plan is to grow it at 25-26% in next 2-3 years The pharma intermediates will become 30-35% of business The pharma intermediates have higher margins than Agrochem intermediates This was the business update of SRF
Generally, their chemical business seems to be on track They are doing a capex of 12-3K crs & they have right to win as well Because in speciality chem business they don’t have competition to 70-80% business in India They’re monopoly in the 70-80% specialty chemical business This is to be remembered But when we look at Antithesis pointers in maintenance research 1st: Navin Fluorine & GFL are also expanding in R32 as mentioned in concalls GFL is setting up a capacity of 10K MTPA for R32 This can lead to some pricing realization dipping because their growth in RGs was 100%(EBIT) There has been growth in RGs pricing as well You can see, some have started softening but some are rising higher That is to be seen, If RGs pricing goes lower It can be a near term Antithesis There is a risk of fire, their facility caught fire in FY21 causing casualty This risk is in all the chemical co’s 3rd key risk: There is an ongoing bad cycle in packaging business Be it Cosmofilms, Polyplex, Jindal Polyfilms & the BOPET cycle has gone bad Because there are many new lines of BOPET in the world The cyclicality is like more supply than demand with 5 new lines in India & China Due to this cyclicality element, the packaging business margins can be depressed As Highlighted, the EBIT margins are 7.6%, 16.7% in Q2 FY23 & Q2 FY22 respectively Technical textile contributes 5% to overall EBIT & it’s not a growing business You have to remember that as well
These were the Antithesis pointers The thesis pointers would be that it won’t even matter after 3-4 years If chemical business can emerge as major portion of the PAT or EBIT That’s what an investor has to look in SRF
Let’s move on to other Co’s Do let me know in the comments section below Just drop a Hell Yes! If you liked the update Do subscribe to the channel if you haven’t done so Before going forward, there is a special announcement We have made a new course in SOIC membership about “How to find epic stock ideas”?

The next co is from the Hospital sector Operates out of Bangalore, Kolkata, Delhi, Ahmedabad & Cayman Islands If you’ve guess it already , you are right Name of the hospital is Narayana Hrudayalaya(NH) There are different types of capex in hospital business As it's an asset heavy business
1 is Green field capex when you enter new city & start it from scratch 2 is Greenfield capex within existing city You have to remember 1 thing In hospital sector, when you set up hospital from scratch There is 5-7 years of breakeven period The breakeven completes quickly upon doing capex in same city As your brand equity is already established Like in Delhi if Ganga Ram establishes hospitals everywhere in Delhi I’m pretty sure the breakeven period will be quick as there is high brand equity of Ganga Ram in Delhi The best type of capex is brownfield capex You are setting up additional beds in existing land of hospital or covert Non-ICU to ICU beds Those are examples
Final is Mergers & Acquisitions i.e., you do cheap acquisitions In the latest business updates, they’ve announced a 1800-2000 crs capex All the capex’s are greenfield within the city
1 is happening in cayman island of 800-1K crs Then eventually to happen in Kolkata & Bangalore In Bangalore they do 30% ebitdar margins & the centre level margins in Kolkata are very high The growth runway can elongate because of this This is something you need to consider about the types of capex’s Let’s see some more growth levers in NH
1 is ALOS i.e., Average Length of Stay is reducing ARPOB i.e., Average Revenue Per Bed is rising at the moment The newer centers are close to breakeven like Gurgaon & Ahmedabad There is increasing complex procedures leading to increase in ARPOB They are also taking digital initiatives to cut sloth These were all the growth levers of hospital
Antithesis pointer would be greenfield capex within same city It’s not a lucrative form of capex. But it’s the need of the business You need to that in order to grow the business
This could be an antithesis pointer in near term But again, you have to do an independent assessment Because the purpose of this video is to make you aware of the newest development in business 3rd business would be Axis Bank
I’ll compare Axis Bank with ICICI Bank You always have to check ROA tree when studying a financial institution ROA tree gets formed from its income statement 1st is interest income & if you subtract interest expend Interest income is the income made from disbursing loans Interest expend is the interest paid to depositors as part of FD The difference would give you NII i.e., Net Interest Income If you add other income to NII i.e., Loan processing fee, credit card fee This would give you total income
These were the revenue sources of bank We can call Gross Profit to a bank's total income As you have excluded the interest expended & you’ll exclude the below the line expenses of bank Those are bank expenses like man power expenses, electricity expenses All these expenses comes below the line for a bank
The major cost is of provisioning called credit cost You always maintain a buffer against bad loans which is from income statement These are known as OPEX & provisioning expenses Cost of electricity, rent & employee is part of OPEX Below the line expenses is for bad asset quality You are maintaining provisions against bad loans Upon subtracting these 2, the PBT of bank is obtained Finally, tax is deducted from PBT. The PAT is obtained ROA is obtained upon dividing PAT/Total Assets ROE is obtained by multiplying ROA & Financial leverage Leverage is bank’s Asset/Equity, If bank has 1 ₹ equity supporting its 10 ₹ assets It means Bank is 10x leveraged If you multiply 10x leveraged with bank’s asset, you’ll get ROE This is beautiful idea of ROA tree & let’s apply it to Axis & ICICI bank If you look at ICICI bank & its ROA tree
The ROE is 17.65% in 1st half of FY23 This is because their ROA is at 1.9% This is because their bad loans provisioning is 0.38% at quarter level There is a growth in interest earned as well
Similarly, Axis Bank’s ROE is at 18.89% ROA is at 1.98%, both the banks are doing well If you look at the valuations of Axis Bank against ICICI Bank It is cheaper than ICICI bank This is how we filter stocks, If return ratios are cheaper than valuations That is when you should study stock You’ll find it in RS scans, Nifty 50 RS scan (proprietary scan at SOIC) It is coming under Bank Nifty RS scan
This is why it makes sense to go & study stock This was the 3rd business idea that we discussed We’ll make videos on the other 2 videos as well 1 is MCX i.e., Multi Commodity Exchange The options volume is exploding with futures value of 24.5K crs Options volume has grown to 27K crs from 4.6K crs In most of the world’s exchanges, options are 10x the volume of futures That will be one of the businesses that we’ll study in future Next idea is about Auto Aesthetic co growing at 20-25% Also growing at 27-30% EBITDA margins This was the business analysis today & we covered 3 businesses in detail The other companies are MCX & SJS Enterprises We’ll cover their analysis in further videos
Thank you so much for joining us Let me know your key takeaways If it was from Banking, Hospital or Chemical section Do let me know in the comments section below Because we’ll be featuring the best comment as well Thank you so much for joining us Hope to see you in the next business analysis video of SOIC Jai Hind
