Based on the provided text, there are three potential stocks that could be considered for investment: SRF, Narayana Hrudayalaya (NH), and Axis Bank.

1. SRF:
SRF is a diversified chemical company with four main businesses: packaging films, technical textiles, chemical business (including refrigerant gases and specialty chemicals), and active ingredients in agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. The company has shown strong growth in its chemical business, with significant increases in top-line growth, EBIT, and PAT. SRF has also announced a new capex plan worth 700 crores in the chemical business, indicating their commitment to expanding and strengthening this segment. The company's monopoly in the specialty chemical business and its focus on forward integration and value-added products are positive indicators for long-term value investing.

2. Narayana Hrudayalaya (NH):
NH is a hospital company operating in multiple cities in India and the Cayman Islands. The company has different types of capex plans, including greenfield capex within existing cities and mergers and acquisitions. NH has announced a capex of 1800-2000 crores for greenfield expansion within cities like Kolkata and Bangalore. The growth levers for NH include reducing average length of stay, increasing average revenue per bed, and taking digital initiatives to improve efficiency. While greenfield capex within the same city may not be as lucrative, NH's strong brand equity and increasing complex procedures can contribute to long-term growth.

3. Axis Bank:
Axis Bank is a financial institution that has shown strong return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) ratios. The company's ROE and ROA for the first half of FY23 are higher than those of ICICI Bank, indicating better performance. Axis Bank's valuation is also relatively cheaper compared to ICICI Bank, making it an attractive investment opportunity. Further analysis can be done by studying the bank's income statement, interest income, net interest income, total income, provisioning expenses, and profitability ratios to gain a deeper understanding of its financial performance.

Overall, these three stocks show potential for long-term value investing based on their financial performance, growth prospects, and valuations. However, it is important to conduct further analysis and research to assess the risks and make informed investment decisions.
