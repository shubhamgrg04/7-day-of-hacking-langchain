# 7 Days of Hacking Langchain


Welcome to the LangChain Hacking Challenge! This repository is created to document my journey of learning and exploring **LangChain**. In this challenge, I aim to hack into seven different projects using LangChain over the course of seven days.

## Challenge Overview

This Challenge is a week-long journey where I will be targeting seven diverse projects covering all the major concepts of Langchain. Each day, I will select a new project targeting a specific concept.

Throughout this challenge, I will document my findings, insights, and code snippets in the corresponding daily folders. Feel free to explore the repository and follow along with my progress.

## Repository Structure

Each daily folder will contain a dedicated README.md file explaining the project and code snippets.

- **Day 1:** [Youtube stock recommendations summary](day1/)


## Getting started

**Create a new virtual environment**

```shell
pyenv virtualenv 3.11 7daysofhackinglangchain
pyenv activate 7daysofhackinglangchain
```

**Install required packages**
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Contributing

While this repository is primarily meant for documenting my personal challenge, I welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback from the community. If you have any ideas, improvements, or questions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.


Happy hacking!
